# ecommerce
Assignment - Java e-commerce backend

I have written code as per instructions.
1. AuthenticateInterceptor > There can be many more things which could be added to code, Like authentication and authorization mechanism in AuthenticateInterceptor class
2. I have Used inmemory H2 database for assignment
3. EcommerceExceptionController > can have more exceptions handled
4. We can write seperate services and Dao's for different actors like product, orders, users etc.
5. While handling requests, validation may differ in service, dao or even controller layer [i have added some validations as example]
6. Payment gateway Integration code is not written, but we can do as needed
7. we can have custom logger files if needed
8. I have created Entities in entities package, which has relationships to each other

FINALLY,
I would say, there are many things that I can do here, but as a part of assignment there are required things only [Like skeleton].
I can use Different Design patterns, LRU cache, schedulers, Hibernate second level cache if needed.
